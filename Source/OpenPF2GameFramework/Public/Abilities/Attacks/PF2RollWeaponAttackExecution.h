/**
 * Gameplay effect execution calculation for attempting a weapon attack and calculating appropriate damage amount(s).
 *
 * After invocation, the degree of success for the attack is available in the
 * @code TmpAttackDegreeOfSuccessProperty @endcode transient attack attribute, even if the attack was unsuccessful
 * (i.e., a failure or critical failure).
 *
 * This execution does not directly inflict damage on the target. Instead, on a successful attack, this execution
 * calculates damage and applies it to the transient attack attribute that corresponds to the primary damage type for
 * the weapon the source has equipped. If there is additional damage that the weapon should inflict (e.g., from a rune),
 * that can be handled by separate GEs that apply buffs and additional damage to the desired transient attack
 * attributes on the source.
 *
 * Once all the damage from the current attack has been calculated (including bonuses, penalties, runes, etc.), damage
 * can be inflicted on each target through the PF2ApplyDamageFromSourceExecution, which factors in each target's
 * resistances to each type of damage being applied and then applies the total resulting damage to the transient
 * incoming damage property on the target.
 *
 * Modifiers in the output of an execution can only affect attributes on the GE target, so this execution is designed to
 * be used only in a GE that is being applied to the SOURCE of an attack (i.e., the GE should be applied to the
 * character who is attacking, as part of the "Source Gameplay Effects" on the weapon).

	 * "When making an attack roll, determine the result by rolling 1d20 and adding your attack modifier for the weapon
	 * or unarmed attack you’re using. Modifiers for melee and ranged attacks are calculated differently.
	 *
	 * Melee attack modifier = Strength modifier (or optionally Dexterity for a finesse weapon) + proficiency bonus +
	 * other bonuses + penalties
	 *
	 * Ranged attack modifier = Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
	 *

	 * an item bonus to your attack rolls."

	 * or fail. Exceptional results—either good or bad—can cause you to critically succeed at or critically fail a
	 * check.
	 *
	 * You critically succeed at a check when the check’s result meets or exceeds the DC by 10 or more. If the check is
	 * an attack roll, this is sometimes called a critical hit. You can also critically fail a check. The rules for
	 * critical failure—sometimes called a fumble—are the same as those for a critical success, but in the other
	 * direction: if you fail a check by 10 or more, that’s a critical failure.
	 *
	 * If you rolled a 20 on the die (a “natural 20”), your result is one degree of success better than it would be by
	 * numbers alone. If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”), your result is one degree worse."
